# MakeOI23

Created a project for Ohio State's yearly hardware focused Hackathon called MakeOhio. This team consists of Raagul, 
Rahul, Marty, and Pranav. All second year CSE students at OSU. 

What is our project?

Amidst the earthquakes in Turkey and Syria we wanted to create a project that solved issues of 
caused by natural disaster like infrastructure damage and finding people amidst rubble. Our team fixed the 
problem by creating a Search And Rescue (SAR) vehicle that would drive around while emmiting wifi from a 
Raspberry Pi
